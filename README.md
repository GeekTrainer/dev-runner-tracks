# Runner Tracker

Runner Tracker is a simple web application that allows users to search and find runners in a race. The application is built with TypeScript, Express and Prisma.

## Key folders

- `/server`: Server-side code, including routes, APIs and services.
- `/public`: Static files for the front-end.
- `/prisma`: Prisma schema and migrations, and the SQLite database.

## Running the application

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the application in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Project notes

As a demo project, the application isn't fully featured. It's also hardwired to use a SQLite database.

## Disclaimer

This project is a work in progress and is not yet complete. The application is not fully functional and may contain bugs. The race data was generated by AI; any resemblance to actual races is purely coincidental.
